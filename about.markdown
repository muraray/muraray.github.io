Well so to say, following are the attributes may fit in my dictionary

    use std::collections::HashMap;

    fn main() {
    
        // Type inference lets us omit an explicit type signature
        // (which would be `HashMap<String, String>` in this example).
        let mut my_attributes = HashMap::new();

        my_attributes.insert(
            "I'm newbee and avid learner", 
            "So can only take less critisium",
        );

        my_attributes.insert(
            "If you believe i was a forwarder",
            "My goal is to post atleast one in a week",
        );  

        println!("my_attributes has the value {:?}", my_attributes);
    }
